 Exercise in using previously learned visual formats for a simple web page, via The Odin Project

My second real assignment with The Odin Project (aka TOP).  This time a single page website displaying multiple flexbox stylings, such as:
	
	* Utilizing different types of containers
		- A more complex header
		- Single container with image
		- Side by side 'information' containers
		- Quote container with text
		- Footer container
	* 'Buttons' - that don't do anything yet

This is made possible using the tools I have learned thus far.  I may go back and restyle it afterwards.

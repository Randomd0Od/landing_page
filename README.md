My second real assignment with The Odin Project (aka TOP).  This time a single page website displaying multiple flexbox stylings, such as:
	
	* HTML
	* CSS	
	* Flexbox
		- Utilizing different types of containers
			+ A more complex header
			+ Single container with image
			+ Side by side 'information' containers
			+ Quote container with text
			+ Footer container
	* 'Buttons' - that don't do anything yet

This is made possible using the tools I have learned thus far.  I may go back and restyle it afterwards.
